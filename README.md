#Spaceflight Simulator Configuration File Parser (WIP)
This is my attempt at making an interpreter for the configuration file of the
flight simulator project that I'm working on. It is also my attempt at learnign
the principles behind an interpreter, so please forgive me if it looks bad.

### Nowhere near finished!!
